### üìã Each Subject Contains
- **README.md** - Comprehensive overview, learning path, and project roadmap
- **notes/** - Study materials, concept explanations, and reference documentation
- **exercises/** - Step-by-step practice challenges with detailed explanations
- **projects/** - Real-world applications that demonstrate mastery

### üéØ Learning Philosophy: "Vibe Coding"
This system is built around **learning by building**:
- **Code with Purpose**: Every project solves a real problem or explores genuine curiosity
- **Connect Everything**: Subjects naturally integrate (Chinese + Python = flashcard apps!)
- **Document the Journey**: Your code comments and notes become your personal textbook
- **Iterate and Improve**: Start simple, add features, refine over time

## üöÄ Recommended Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Start with Git - Essential for everything else!**
1. Complete `subjects/git/exercises/01_first_commit.md` 
2. Initialize Git in this brain directory: `git init`
3. Make your first commit: Save this entire learning environment
4. Learn the basic workflow: edit ‚Üí add ‚Üí commit

### Phase 2: Choose Your Primary Interest (Week 2-4)
Pick the subject that excites you most:

**üêç Python Track** (Great for beginners)
- Build your first utility script
- Learn proper code commenting (remember: lots of comments!)
- Create tools that help your other studies

**ü§ñ AI Track** (For the curious)
- Start with simple rule-based systems
- Build an AI assistant for note organization
- Explore language models and APIs

**üá®üá≥ Chinese Track** (Language + Code combo)
- Create a digital flashcard system
- Build character recognition tools
- Combine language learning with programming

**ü§î Philosophy Track** (Critical thinking + Code)
- Build argument mapping tools
- Create reflection generators
- Apply logical thinking to code structure

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 4+)
- Start cross-subject projects in `subjects/projects/`
- Build tools that combine multiple interests
- Document your learning journey in `prd.md`

## üéØ Project Ideas by Complexity

### üü¢ Beginner Projects (Start Here!)
1. **File Organizer** (Python): Sort your learning materials automatically
2. **Git Practice Repository** (Git): Learn version control with a practice project
3. **Simple Calculator** (Coding): Build basic programming logic
4. **Daily Reflection Tool** (Philosophy): Generate structured thinking prompts
5. **Chinese Word Counter** (Chinese): Count characters in text files

### üü° Intermediate Projects (After 2-3 weeks)
1. **Chinese Flashcard App** (Chinese + Python): Interactive CLI vocabulary trainer
2. **Study Schedule Generator** (AI + Python): Smart scheduling based on your habits
3. **Code Comment Generator** (AI + Coding): AI tool that explains your code
4. **Philosophy Argument Mapper** (Philosophy + Coding): Visualize logical structures
5. **Learning Progress Dashboard** (Python + All subjects): Track your growth

### üî¥ Advanced Integration Projects (After 1+ months)
1. **Multilingual AI Tutor** (AI + Chinese + Python): Personalized language learning assistant
2. **Philosophical Code Analyzer** (Philosophy + AI + Coding): Analyze coding decisions through ethical frameworks
3. **Cross-Subject Knowledge Graph** (All subjects): Connect learnings across disciplines
4. **Personal Learning OS** (All subjects): Comprehensive system for managing your education

## üí° Core Learning Principles

### 1. Comment-Driven Development
- **Write extensive comments**: Explain EVERY function, variable, and decision
- **Comments as teaching**: Pretend you're explaining to someone with basic CS knowledge
- **Document your thinking**: Why did you choose this approach?

### 2. Build-First Philosophy
- **Working > Perfect**: Get something functional before optimizing
- **Iterate rapidly**: Version 1 ‚Üí Version 2 ‚Üí Version N
- **Learn through breaking**: Make mistakes and fix them

### 3. Cross-Subject Integration
- **Connect everything**: Look for intersections between subjects
- **Apply philosophy to code**: How do ethical frameworks inform programming decisions?
- **Use code for learning**: Build tools that enhance your study of other subjects

### 4. Documentation as Learning
- **Track your journey**: Every Git commit tells a story
- **Explain concepts**: Write notes as if teaching someone else
- **Reflect regularly**: Use the philosophy reflection template
