# PRD: Personal Learning Environment (Vibe Coding School)

## Vision Statement
Create a **comprehensive, self-directed learning ecosystem** within Cursor IDE that transforms education through **vibe coding** - learning by building meaningful, curiosity-driven projects. This environment functions as a personalized university where every concept is reinforced through hands-on application, extensive documentation, and cross-disciplinary integration.

### Core Philosophy
- **Learning Through Building**: Every concept learned must be applied in a real project
- **Comment-Driven Development**: Code serves as both application and textbook through extensive commenting
- **Cross-Pollination**: Subjects naturally integrate to create unique learning opportunities
- **Iterative Mastery**: Start simple, build complexity through progressive enhancement
