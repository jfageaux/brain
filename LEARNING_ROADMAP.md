# Personal Learning Environment - Comprehensive Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

## üéØ Overview: Your Journey from Foundation to Mastery

This roadmap provides a structured, yet flexible path through your personal learning environment. Based on the "vibe coding" philosophy, it emphasizes learning through building while maintaining rigorous documentation standards that reflect your one year of CS background.

### Core Principles
- **Comment-Driven Development**: Every project serves as both functional code and educational content
- **Cross-Subject Integration**: Subjects naturally connect and reinforce each other
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build sophistication over time
- **Practical Application**: Every concept learned must be applied in real projects

## üìÖ Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1: Essential Tooling & Git Mastery
**Priority**: Establish version control and development environment

#### Monday-Tuesday: Git Setup & Basic Workflow
- **Morning (1 hour)**: Complete `subjects/git/exercises/01_first_commit.md`
- **Afternoon (30 min)**: Initialize brain repository: `git init` ‚Üí first commit
- **Evening (30 min)**: Read `subjects/git/notes/getting_started.md`
- **Project**: Version control this entire learning environment

#### Wednesday-Thursday: Development Environment
- **Morning (1 hour)**: Install Python, set up virtual environments:
  # Virtual Environment Setup
  - Install virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv` 
    # virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments
    # this keeps project dependencies separate and avoids conflicts
  
  - Create project-specific environments with `virtualenv venv`
    # 'venv' is the standard name for virtual environment directories
    # this creates a new directory with a fresh Python installation
    # activate with 'source venv/bin/activate' on Unix or 'venv\Scripts\activate' on Windows
  
  - Learn conda for data science/ML projects
    # conda is a package/environment management system, not a protocol
    # it's an application that helps install and manage packages
    # created by Anaconda Inc. specifically for data science
    # handles both Python and non-Python package dependencies
    # includes its own package repository called conda-forge
    # conda is preferred for data science because it manages non-Python dependencies
    # handles complex packages like numpy, scipy, tensorflow more reliably
    # provides pre-built binaries optimized for scientific computing
  
  - Understand when to use each:
    # virtualenv:
    #   - Simple Python web apps and scripts
    #   - When you only need pure Python packages
    #   - Lighter weight, faster to create
    # conda:
    #   - Data science and machine learning
    #   - Projects needing C/Fortran dependencies
    #   - When you need specific versions of Python packages
- **Afternoon (45 min)**: Set up code formatting tools (Black, pylint)
- **Evening (30 min)**: Configure Cursor IDE for optimal Python development
- **Project**: Create standardized development environment setup script that:
  - Automates virtualenv creation for new Python projects
  - Configures conda environments for data/ML work
  - Documents virtual environment best practices
