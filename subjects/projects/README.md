# Cross-Disciplinary Projects üåê

Welcome to your integration hub! This directory is for projects that combine multiple subjects - the heart of **vibe coding**.

## Purpose
This space is for building projects that naturally combine skills from different subjects, creating a more holistic learning experience.

## Example Projects from PRD
- **AI-Powered Study Buddy**: Combines AI + Python + Chinese (quizzes you in Chinese, explains philosophy, helps debug code)
- **Philosophy Essay Assistant**: AI + Philosophy + Python (helps structure arguments, suggests related concepts)
- **Chinese Learning Game**: Chinese + Coding + Python (interactive text-based game for language practice)
- **Learning Analytics Dashboard**: Python + AI + All Subjects (tracks and analyzes your progress across all areas)

## Project Categories

### üéØ **Learning Tools**
Projects that help you learn better across subjects
- Study schedulers and habit trackers
- Cross-subject quiz systems
- Learning progress visualizers

### üîÑ **Integration Projects**
Projects that naturally require multiple skill sets
- Language learning apps with AI features
- Philosophy argument analyzers
- Code documentation with philosophical comments

### üöÄ **Personal Systems**
Tools that improve your daily learning workflow
- Automated note organization
- Cross-reference systems between subjects
- Personal knowledge management tools

## Getting Started
1. Pick two subjects that interest you most
2. Think of a small problem you face in your learning
3. Build a simple tool that addresses that problem
4. Gradually add features from other subjects

## Development Approach
- **Start Small**: Begin with the simplest version that works
- **Iterate**: Add one feature at a time
- **Document**: Explain how different subjects contribute
- **Reflect**: Update the main PRD with your progress
