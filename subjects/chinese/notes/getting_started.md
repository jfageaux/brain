# Getting Started with Chinese + Programming 🇨🇳💻

## 🎯 Your First Day Setup (15-30 minutes)

### Step 1: Chinese Input Method Setup
**Windows:**
1. Settings → Time & Language → Language → Add Language → Chinese (Simplified)
2. Enable Microsoft Pinyin IME
3. Test typing: Try typing "nihao" and selecting 你好

**Mac:**
1. System Preferences → Keyboard → Input Sources → + → Chinese, Simplified → Pinyin - Simplified
2. Test with Command+Space, type "nihao", select 你好

**Linux:**
1. Install IBus: `sudo apt install ibus-libpinyin`
2. Configure in Settings → Region & Language

### Step 2: Essential Character Recognition
Learn these 20 characters first (most common + programming relevant):

**Numbers & Basic:**
- 一 (yī) = one
- 二 (èr) = two  
- 三 (sān) = three
- 四 (sì) = four
- 五 (wǔ) = five

**Programming & Technology:**
- 电 (diàn) = electricity/electric
- 脑 (nǎo) = brain
- 机 (jī) = machine
- 文 (wén) = text/document  
- 件 (jiàn) = item/software

**Daily Use:**
- 我 (wǒ) = I/me
- 你 (nǐ) = you
- 他 (tā) = he/him
- 中 (zhōng) = middle/China
- 国 (guó) = country

**Verbs:**
- 是 (shì) = to be
- 有 (yǒu) = to have
- 做 (zuò) = to do/make
- 学 (xué) = to learn
- 写 (xiě) = to write

### Step 3: Your First Programming Project (Today!)

Copy this simple character counter and run it:

```python
# character_counter.py - Your first Chinese programming project!

def count_chinese_characters(text):
    """
    Count Chinese characters in a text string.
    
    Learning Goals:
    - Practice Chinese character recognition
    - Learn basic string processing in Python
    - Understand Unicode and Chinese text encoding
    """
    chinese_chars = 0
    other_chars = 0
    
    for char in text:
        # Chinese characters are in Unicode range 4E00-9FFF
        if '\u4e00' <= char <= '\u9fff':
            chinese_chars += 1
        elif char != ' ':  # Don't count spaces
            other_chars += 1
    
    return chinese_chars, other_chars

# Test with the characters you just learned!
test_text = "我学习中文和编程。I am learning Chinese and programming."

chinese_count, other_count = count_chinese_characters(test_text)

print(f"Chinese characters: {chinese_count}")
print(f"Other characters: {other_count}")
print(f"Text analyzed: {test_text}")
```

Run this and see: You just processed Chinese text with code!
