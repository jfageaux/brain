# Philosophy Learning Journey ü§î

Welcome to your **philosophical thinking and reasoning hub**! This directory focuses on general philosophy: logic, ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, political philosophy, and philosophy of science. Practical mini-projects are suggested as optional ways to practice clear thinking (with or without code).
