# Git Version Control Learning Journey üîß

Welcome to your Git learning directory! This follows the **vibe coding** approach - learning version control through practical, hands-on projects.

## What is Git?
Git is a **version control system** - think of it as a way to:
- Save snapshots of your code (called "commits") 
- Track what changes were made and when
- Work on multiple features at the same time (branches)
- Collaborate with others without conflicts
- Go back to previous versions if something breaks

## Structure
- `notes/` - Git concepts, command references, and study materials
- `exercises/` - Step-by-step Git practice scenarios  
- `projects/` - Real projects where you'll practice Git workflows

## Learning Path üõ§Ô∏è

### Phase 1: Git Basics (Start Here!)
**Goal**: Understand what Git does and learn basic commands
- Read `notes/getting_started.md` - Core concepts explained simply
- Complete `exercises/01_first_commit.md` - Your first Git repository
- Complete `exercises/02_staging_and_commits.md` - Learn the Git workflow

### Phase 2: Working with History
**Goal**: Navigate and understand your project's history
- Complete `exercises/03_viewing_history.md` - See what happened when
- Complete `exercises/04_undoing_changes.md` - Fix mistakes safely

### Phase 3: Branching (Game Changer!)
**Goal**: Work on multiple features simultaneously
- Read `notes/branching_explained.md` - Why branches are powerful
- Complete `exercises/05_basic_branching.md` - Create and switch branches
- Complete `exercises/06_merging.md` - Combine your work

### Phase 4: Remote Repositories 
**Goal**: Share your code and collaborate
- Complete `exercises/07_github_basics.md` - Push your code online
- Complete `exercises/08_collaboration.md` - Work with others

### Phase 5: Real-World Workflows
**Goal**: Use Git like a professional developer
- Complete `projects/portfolio_website/` - Build and version a website
- Complete `projects/coding_journal/` - Track your programming progress

## Essential Git Commands (Quick Reference)

```bash
# Getting started
git init                    # Create a new Git repository
git clone <url>            # Download an existing repository

# Basic workflow
git add <file>             # Stage changes for commit
git add .                  # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"    # Save a snapshot with description
git status                 # See what's changed
git log                    # View commit history

# Branching
git branch                 # List branches
git branch <name>          # Create new branch
git checkout <branch>      # Switch to branch
git merge <branch>         # Combine branches

# Remote repositories
git remote add origin <url>  # Connect to GitHub/GitLab
git push origin main         # Upload your commits
git pull origin main         # Download new commits
```

## Why Learn Git? üí™
1. **Never lose code again** - Git tracks everything
2. **Experiment safely** - Try new features on separate branches
3. **Professional requirement** - All development teams use version control
4. **Collaborate effectively** - Work with others without stepping on toes
5. **Portfolio building** - Show your coding journey on GitHub

## Project Ideas from PRD
- **Personal Code Portfolio**: Use Git to track all your learning projects
- **Study Notes Repository**: Version control your notes from all subjects
- **Open Source Contributions**: Contribute to real projects on GitHub

## Getting Started Right Now! üöÄ
1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to `subjects/git/exercises/`
3. Start with `01_first_commit.md`
4. Follow along step-by-step (don't skip anything!)

## Cross-Subject Connections
- **+ Python**: Version control all your Python projects and scripts
- **+ AI**: Track experiments and model versions using Git
- **+ Chinese**: Use Git to manage your language learning materials
- **+ Coding**: Essential skill for all programming projects
- **+ Philosophy**: Study the philosophy of collaboration and knowledge sharing

## Important Notes üìù
- **Practice regularly** - Git skills build through repetition
- **Make mistakes** - Git makes it safe to experiment and learn
- **Ask questions** - Git can be confusing at first, that's normal!
- **Read commit messages** - They tell the story of your project
